     UNARJ LICENSE POLICY FOR ALL USERS:

The UNARJ program, source code, and the associated documentation
are copyright (c) 1990-2002 ARJ Software, Inc. all rights reserved.

If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
originally released:  UNARJ265.EXE with the ARJ-SECURITY envelope as
created by the author.  If you must distribute the UNARJ archive in
another archive format, please archive the UNARJ265.EXE as one file
inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as separate
files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

You may freely use the UNARJ C source code.  If you wish to
distribute a modified version of UNARJ, you MUST indicate that it
is a modified version both in the program and source code.

We are holding the copyright on the source code, so please do not
delete our name from the program files or the documentation.

You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ, provided that no
fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

You may use UNARJ in a commercial software package provided that
no additional fee is charged for using UNARJ and provided that
the user fully understands that NO warranty or support is provided
for UNARJ by ARJ Software.  Moreover, the user must fully
understand that UNARJ does not have the long usage history that ARJ
does.

This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.

The following message is an extract from Rob Jung - the author of
unarj he was asked if unarj could comply to the addendum;

I have no problem with that license statement.  I encourage distribution of 
the source and binaries.

The current debian source package was created by extracting the
upstream unarj265.exe using an existing unarj binary and creating a
tar.gz from it. Not all the files listed above are found in that
upstream package! I am assuming therefore that the existing list of
files (below) is an acceptable substitute. I'd rather not include a
Windows (gack!) binary as part of the upstream "source", but...

    bcc32.cfg
    bcc32.mak
    bccunarj.mak
    decode.c
    environ.c
    os2unarj.mak
    qclunarj.mak
    readme.txt
    tccunarj.mak
    technote.txt
    turboc.cfg
    unarj.c
    unarj.exe
    unarj.h
    unarj.txt
    unarj32.exe

A patch to allow extraction of named files to stdout has been applied,
as in the previous releases of unarj.
